                        You're going to need clean food-and plenty of it-to fuel up for-and recover from-Kris's insanely challenging workouts over the next 12 weeks. You'll definitely get bigger, but don't plan on putting on any additional body fat. If anything, you might even burn some due to the training intensity. Kris doesn't believe a bulk is an excuse to eat whatever dirty calories find their way to your plate. He believes in lean, clean gains. This is how your diet will look over the next three months.

                        If you've followed Gethin's Hardcore Trainer before, you'll find that this trainer will provide a little more variety in your diet. You'll be able to eat healthy fats, fruit, and even some dairy. This variety is included to fuel your muscle growth and help you recover between workouts. That said, you should approach your nutrition during this muscle-building plan the same way you approach your training or anything else. True growth isn't 30 percent training, 30 percent nutrition, and so on. It's 100 percent training, 100 percent motivation, 100 percent effort-and 100 percent nutrition. You are what you eat, especially once you begin adding weight.

                    <strong>YOUR MUSCLE-BUILDING MEAL PLAN</strong><br/>

                    You'll be eating six meals per day, a number familiar to anyone who has gone through Gethin's other trainers. The macronutrient breakdown is slightly different than Hardcore or DTP, and the overall calories are slightly higher to ensure quality gains. The reasoning behind the breakdown is this: On your training days, your muscles require more fuel, which means more carbohydrates are necessary. But on your non-training days, you need to recover, which is why your protein is up. For optimal recovery, your hormones also need to be balanced, which is why your fat is up and your carbohydrates are down on non-training days. The training is going to intensify every single week of the Muscle-Building Trainer, and your body will have no choice but to grow in response. As your training utilizes more and more energy (calories) and your body weight increases, your daily calorie intake should increase accordingly by roughly 100-200 calories every week. Kris will remind you of this each week when the time comes. That said, the math can still get a little complicated, considering that you'll be increasing your calories every week, and your macros are going to change from your training days and your non-training days. Adding to the complication, your weight could rise fairly dramatically over the next 12 weeks, and everyone gains muscle at a different rate.

                        You can't eat anything fried, anything with trans fats, or anything with refined sugar. You shouldn't drink coffees packed with cream and get to work. Your body will take it from there.
