                        The biggest benefit of supplements during Kris Gethin's Muscle Building Trainer can be summed up in a single word recovery. The training journey you're about to take will be tough from day one, and it only gets tougher. Your recuperative abilities will be strained, even with an airtight diet and plenty of rest Strategic supplementation is essential to restore your damaged muscle fibers and help you face the next day's challenges.

                    <strong>ESSENTIAL SUPPLEMENTS</strong><br/>

                    <strong>MULTIVITAMIN</strong><br/>

                    Hard training depletes your body of a wide range of nutrients, and if you don't replace them, your energy level and results can suffer dramatically. Cover any micronutrient gaps in your diet and give your body what it needs by founding your supplement stack on a quality multivitamin. <br/>
                    
                    <strong>PROTEIN</strong><br/>

                    Protein is essential for tissue growth and repair. You can go to war in the gym, but if you don't eat an adequate amount of protein daily. you simply won't grow or get stronger. Protein is your highest dietary priority over the weeks to come, and a post-workout shake is non-negotiable. <br/>

                    <strong>PRE-WORKOUT</strong><br/>

                    OK, so supplementation isn't all about recovery during this program It's also about making sure your intensity doesn't flag during your workout so you can give your body the loudest possible message to grow. A good pre-workout achieves this by helping you experience benefits like:<br/>

                    - Sharp mental alertness and focus -High energy levels -Explosive muscular energy<br/>
                    - Better blood flow and pumps<br/>
                    - Explosive muscular energy
                    - Better blood flow<br/>


                    <strong>LEUCINE/BCAAS</strong><br/>

                    of the three br/anched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), leucine is the most effective at stimulating muscle protein synthesis, and subsequently, muscle growth. If BCAAs are the building blocks of muscle, leucine is by far the biggest br/ick in the pile. You're welcome to additionally supplement with BCAA drink mixes during the day, and they're essential as an intra-workout supplement. But to maximize recovery and growth between workouts, consider adding additional luicine to support your transformation. <br/>

                    <strong>GLUTAMINE</strong><br/>

                    Kris has been a long-time believer in the restorative powers of glutamine. Why? Because he also believes in br/utal workouts that test the body's physical and mental limits. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body, and the role it plays in recovery is undisputed. But here's what you might not know: You can lose up to 50 percent of your glutamine levels during intense training. Don't put yourself at risk of muscle loss; send in reinforcements! <br/>

                    <strong>ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS TESTOSTERONE BOOSTER</strong><br/>

                    Testosterone is your best ally against Kris Gethin's cruelty, and you should do everything possible to naturally support your production. This means sleeping well, eating right, and avoiding sugar and alcohol. But for the next 12 weeks, you should also consider adding a testosterone booster to the mix. It's an easy way of maximizing your body's anabolic potential, so you'll look and feel strong even in the heat of battle. <br/>

                    <strong>VITAMIN D</strong><br/>

                    Few if any of us get enough vitamin D, and even those of us whomeet the arbitrary (and highly arguable) standards can usually benefit from more. If you've never tried supplementing with vitamin D before, you may be surprised what a dramatic effect it can have on things like energy level and mood-especially if you're starting the Muscle Building Trainer in the dead of winter! <br/>

                    sessions: green tea, caffeine, L-citrulline, BCAAs and glutamine. He typically takes these with coconut water.<br/>
